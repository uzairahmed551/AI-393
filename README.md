AI Project Report

K-nearest neighbors' calculation is generally novel and straightforward. It is also utilized in AI to use it for both the issues known as order and relapse. The most memorable part it is not difficult to carry out and simple to get. It has a problem it is moderate and the size of the information used to develops. 

SVM  is the most robust, solid, and recognizable AI calculation utilized for both capacity characterization and relapse. However, more often than not, it is being used for order issues. It got some extraordinary and expert method of in henceforth execution as a correction to other AI calculation.

Na√Øve Bayes Classifier s an AI model fundamentally utilized for an enormous measure of information and useful for the utilization of grouping for specific new strategies of discrete highlights. On the off chance that we take MultinomialNB dissemination, it ordinarily requires a numeric tally. 

(k-NN) is a generally straight-forward procedure to examine the class of a thing dependent on at least two numeric indicator factors. For instance, we can say that an individual depends on his age, yearly pay, sex, long stretches of instruction, etc. Another factor that I notice among the different issues that affect the exhibition of the KNN recipe is that the choice of the hyper boundary k. If k is essentially too small, the equation would be extra touchy to data focuses that territory unit anomaly.

Contribution :
**Uzair (61842)** i have weighted code of all these algorithms, i.e., convolution of KNN, SVM, and MultinomialKB in 5x5, 7x7, and 9x9

wali (61030) i weighted convolution of KNN 5x5, 7x7, 9x9, SVM 5x5, 7x7, 9x9 and MultinomailNB 5x5, 7x7, 9x9

Convolution is accomplished by applying it over and over on the test document until our ideal outcome it acquired
